For our test cells, we chose all different rooms for the door tests making sure that they had doors opening up in all 4 directions. Our kitchen doors
open to the right, the crematorium has a door opening down, and the reptile room has doors opening both left and upwards. We plan on adding a set for 
our doorways so that our program can check isDoorway() against that rather than cycling through all of the rooms every time it is called, however we 
will implement that in Part II. For checking individual cell initials, we tried to choose extrema cells such as the 4 corners or cells right on the 
border to make sure that the whole board loaded correctly. We also tested the closet and a walkway square to make sure those were aligned correctly as 
well. All constants involving size were also checked against our board and legend to ensure correct initialization.
